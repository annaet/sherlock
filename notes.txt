Sherlock

Game concept:

- Game lasts 20 ticks
- Each tick lasts a certain length of time (eg. 20 seconds)
- Each tick is a single turn for the player
- Each tick the player can choose up to 2 cameras to view
- There are hot ticks and cold ticks
- Cold ticks only show the location
- Hot ticks show the location + some objects
- Objects can include characters/fruit/sport
- Each tick the player needs to choose cameras, survey the objects in the cameras and communicate the details of the scene to sherlock through chat

Requirements:

- JSON Config file
- List of locations
- Camera view area
- Chat area
- Info area to display characters/objects

Todo:

- Logger
- Write game ticks (generate from script)
- Decide on game config
- Random/algorithm dictated camera selection (config flag)
- Set up game ticks in CE
- Create characters without tops as image so a user can't just change CSS to find out top colour
